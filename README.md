## **Manually Controllable Gazebo Manikin**

### Usage

1. `gazebo_extra_plugins` is a ros package that can be compiled directly into the workspace to generate the required plugins.

2. `actor.world` is the world file that uses the plugin generated by itself. Note that `devel/lib` needs to be added to the environment variable of Gazebo before opening, otherwise it will not work properly.

3. Step:
    - `roscore` to run ros master.
    - `gazebo actor.world` to run file.
    - Then the `rosrun` running package provides keyboard_actor_pyqt.py or keyboard_actor.py to control pedestrians. (The control methods are i->forward, j->turn left, l->turn right, the pyqt version can monitor the pressing and releasing events of the button, and the realized control is lower latency.)
